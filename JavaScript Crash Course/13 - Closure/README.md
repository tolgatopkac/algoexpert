# Closure

### Closure

A function along with a saved reference to the **lexical environment** it was defined in. Simply put, this means functions have access to all of the variables in scope at the time of definition, even if the parent function has returned.

### Lexical Environment

An internal data structure used for keeping track of identifiers (variable and function names) and their values. A lexical environment stores all of the locally available identifiers as well a reference to the parent environment.

### Lexical Scoping

The scoping system in JavaScript that ensures all code blocks have access to all identifiers in their parent environment. When an identifier is not defined locally, JavaScript will look to the parent environment for it. If it is still not found there, it will look in grandparent's environment and so on before looking in the global environment.
